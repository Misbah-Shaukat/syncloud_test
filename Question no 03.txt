 3) In production; service processes usually go down for many reasons. how to
ensure they get restarted when that happens ?

Answer:
There is a script that always works well, and I always use it. 
This script always rerun the process if it ever get haulted due to any reason
ensuring an always running process.
***
from subprocess import run
from time import sleep
import time
# Path and name to the script you are trying to start
file_path = "ray_dask_lgs.py" 
restart_timer =3

def start_script():
    try:
        print("restarted")
        run("python "+file_path, check=True) 
    except:
        handle_crash()
def handle_crash():
    sleep(restart_timer)  # Restarts the script after 2 seconds
    start_script()
start_script()
