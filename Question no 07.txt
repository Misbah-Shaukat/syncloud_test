7) our sysadmin team deploy our project from github onto two servers, usually
this operation results in a 1 hour downtime. our estimates say we will need
about 20 servers to handle the load during next months. we cannot afford to
have 20 * 1 hours downtime to make new deployments, how can we
efficiently deploy our projects onto these 20 servers with minimal downtime ?

Answer:
The best way is to use  rolling deployment approach. I would solve this problem as follows
1)First, I will divide the 20 servers into smaller groups, let's say four groups of five servers each. 
This way, I could deploy to each group one at a time, this way there is always a portion of the servers 
running and serving the application.
2)I would start with the first group of servers first and performed the deployment process 
on those servers while keeping the other groups running as usual. This would allowe me to avoid 
the complete downtime.
3)Once the deployment on the first group successfully completes, I would moved on to the next group, 
repeating the process until all the groups are updated with the new project version.
