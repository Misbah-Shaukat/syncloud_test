6) python is known to have a global interpreter lock, can you still run python
code in parallel across multiple physical cores ? elaborate on the answer

Answer:
The simplest answer is first deciding whether the task is I/O bound 
or not. If it is I/O bound then multithreading works fine, if not then 
mutltiprocessing is the way to go. But most of the time multithreading 
works alot better if we combine it with other multiprocessing modules like
ray, dask etc. This way it utilizes 100% of the resources in an efficient way.
