2) When you run a database query, how do you make the database send result
data to the client directly without loading all the result set onto its
memory before sending it to client ? ( client here being a script, not the
browser)

Answer:
To avoid loading all the data into memory before sending it to the client, 
the best approach is to use database feature called "cursor-base pagination'
or "result streaming". In simpler words, this approach works by sending the 
data in chunks and if the client/script wants more of a data then we can send 
the next chunk instead of sending all at once. This approach works best and can
work more effectively if the data is saved in an efficient way and the sub-queries
apply to specific columns i.e. conditions are precise and apply to specific set 
instead of all. If there aren't conditions then offset work effectively.  
Consider following as an example
***
SELECT id, name, salary
FROM employee
Where coditions
ORDER BY salary
LIMIT <chunk_size> OFFSET <offset_value>;
